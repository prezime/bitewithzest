  <h2>1. What is a cookie?</h2>
  <p>Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device (e.g. smartphone or tablet) when you visit our sites. 
    A cookie typically contains the name of the website that set it, the lifetime of the cookie (i.e. the period of time the cookie remains on your device) 
    and a value, which is typically a randomly generated unique number.</p>

  <h2>2. What do we use cookies for?</h2>
  <p>We use cookies to make our sites easier to use and to better tailor the sites and our products to your interests and needs. 
    Cookies can do this because websites can read and write these files. This enables them to recognise you and store important information that makes 
    your use of a website more convenient (e.g. by storing your preferred settings).</p>

  <p>Cookies may also be used to help you complete activities on our sites more quickly in the future. 
    Furthermore, we use cookies to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that give us an understanding of the user behaviour of visitors to 
    our sites and help us to improve the structure and content of our sites. The information in cookies does not enable us to identify you personally.</p>

  <h2>3. What types of cookies exist?</h2>
  <p>Two different types of cookies may be used on the sites: so-called "session cookies" and "permanent cookies". 
  Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your device until you leave the site. A permanent cookie, on the other hand, 
  remains on your device for a certain period of time after you have left the site or until you delete it manually 
  (how long a cookie remains on your device depends on the "lifespan" of this cookie).</p>
