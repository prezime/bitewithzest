        <div>What is a veganism?</div>
        <p>"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."
          <br>Vegans avoid all animal products such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meat</li>
          <li>Poultry</li>
          <li>Fish</li>
          <li>Seafood</li>
          <li>Dairy</li>
          <li>Eggs</li>
          <li>Honey</li>
          <li>Gelatin</li>

      <div class="panel">
        <div>Could the plant-based food be unhealthy?</div>  
        <p>Of course, there is also unhealthy plant-based foods. Usually, that food is already prepared in advance, processed and refined. Refined products such as white sugar, white flour, sweet carbonated drinks, some types of oils, canned carp (not all), various additives and preservatives belong to the class of the vegan diet, but according to experts, they do not belong to the group of healthy food. It is not the same if we eat steamed cauliflower salad or fried cauliflower in oil. Fried food contains a lot of fat and in the process itself large amounts of carcinogens are released. The intake of such prepared food is related with a higher risk of developing the disease.</p>

        <div>What should I pay attention to during the transition to a plant-based diet?</div>  
        <p>Eating vegan does not mean eating healthy. Today we can find a large selection of vegan products from pâtés, burgers to cakes that do not contain animal ingredients. Despite this, we do not count them among healthy products. In a plant-based diet, it is important to eat nuts and seeds. Of course, they should not be eaten as a snack in large quantities because they have a high energy value. In this way, we can quickly exceed a person's energy needs for the whole day. Seeds or nuts should not be the basis of a meal, but meals enrich them. Also, you should not overdo it with tofu, seitan, tempeh, herbal drinks. It is enough to eat them once a week as a supplement to meals with less weight.
          It is necessary to take a sufficient amount of nutrients from fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, seeds and nuts. You can find more about meal planning here:</p>

        <div>What are Omega 3 fatty acids?</div>
        <p>Plants do not contain omega 3 fatty acids, but humans have this ability to convert linoleic acid into essential omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies. Interestingly, if we ingest these acids from other things such as fish, then our body’s ability to convert is greatly reduced. You could say the body is drooping.</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <div>Will I get enough protein without meat?</div>
        <p>Getting enough protein is not actually as hard as people will make you think.
          The average adult only needs about 42 grams of protein a day, but most people, including vegans, ingest much more than that amount. Both vegans and omnivores consume an average of 170% of the required amount of protein. Great vegan sources of protein include, tofu, tempeh, seitan, lentils, chickpeas, beans, nuts and seeds.

      <div class="panel">
        <div>Is a vegan diet healthy?</div>
        <p>Of course! A balanced vegan diet with a rich variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, is a healthy diet and provides all the nutrients needed by the human body. Plants are very low in saturated fat and free of cholesterol. Plants are also rich in soluble fiber, which helps lower cholesterol. Learn more about the nutritional needs of plant-based diet:

          Foods of animal origin contain a lot of saturated fats and do not contain fiber, while foods of plant origin are rich in fiber and low in saturated fats. Cholesterol is present only in foods of animal origin. Studies show that foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, obesity, diabetes and cancer. High intake of animal proteins, among other things, also increases the risk of osteoporosis and kidney stones. Plant proteins are not associated with these diseases.</p>

      <button class="accordion"><div>What about vitamin B12?</div></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <div>What about vitamin B12?</div>
        <p>Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria in the soil that enter the body and intestines by consuming plants. There they multiply and produce vitamin B12. These bacteria are usually lacking in plant foods due to today's way of production. Of all the vitamins that the human body needs, vitamin B12 is the least needed in terms of quantity. Its daily intake is measured in micrograms (µg). Algae and fermented foods such as sauerkraut, tempeh, kimchi contain vitamin B12. If it is necessary to add vitamin B12 to the diet, you can use foods enriched with this vitamin (nutritional yeast, soy drink ...).</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <div>Do I get enough iron when eating only vegan?</div>
        <p>There are many plant sources of iron such as dark green leafy vegetables, beans, lentils, grains, nuts and seeds. Vitamin C helps in the absorption of iron and its absorption is better if we add lemon juice or some other food that contains vitamin C (tomato) to dishes. Because too much iron in the body can be harmful to health, taking iron supplements is generally not recommended, except in cases where a blood test has found a deficiency.</p>

      <button class="accordion"><div>Milk products = animal suffering?</div></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <div>Milk products = animal suffering?</div>
        <p>Many people are not aware of the cruelty in the dairy industry. A cow, like a man, has milk only when it has a puppy, because it has to feed it. Cows used in the industry for milk are thus forced into constant pregnancy and constant calving, in order to continue to give milk. Shortly after birth, cows are deprived of their calves - females go on to milk production, while males are an undesirable by-product of the dairy industry and are killed shortly after birth and go for meat production. Cows in the dairy industry are mostly killed at the age of 3, while their natural lifespan is between 20 and 25 years. Milk and dairy products are full of saturated fats and cholesterol, and have been linked to obesity, heart disease, cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis.
It is similar with hens that are killed after a year or two, ie as soon as their egg-laying is reduced. Chickens usually live for about 10 years. Female chickens are further used for production and their ends are cut with a hot knife so as not to injure each other, while male chickens are an undesirable by-product and are usually ground to live.

      <div class="panel">
        <div>And what's with the products that may contain traces of eggs or milk?</div>
        <p>"May contain traces ..." usually only means that the product comes from a production that also uses eggs and milk. This does not mean, however, that eggs and milk are ingredients in the product. The text is usually there because of the limitation of liability in case someone has an allergy to a certain ingredient (mostly these are allergens like eggs, milk, seafood and peanuts). The chance that a product contains such an ingredient is usually very small, and if it is, the amount would probably be negligible. In case you are allergic to any of the ingredients in the product, it is better to avoid it.</p>

        <div>Is alcohol vegan?</div>
        <p>Most wine and beer go through a filtration process called 'fining', which often contains animal ingredients. Traditionally the most commonly used fining agents were casein (a milk protein), albumin (egg whites), gelatin (animal protein) and isinglass (fish bladder protein).
          Although the fining agents is not present in the final product (except perhaps in traces), it is still necessary to use animal ingredients for the process itself. Therefore, alcoholic beverages do not have to be vegan. The regulations on the declaration require the entry of allergens (milk and eggs), but the intake of gelatin and some other animal ingredients is not required. If you are not sure whether the product is vegan or not, it is advisable to contact the manufacturer of a particular product brand. Bourbon, whiskey, vodka, gin, and rum are vegan.</p>

        <div>Why avoid animal-derived apparel materials like leather or wool?</div>
        <p>Numerous types of animal fibers are commonly used to make clothing and apparel. These fibers include down, wool, silk, and fur. All of these materials are invariably tied to a great deal of exploitation and suffering. Additionally, the profits derived from leather production cause more cattle to be raised and slaughtered than would otherwise be produced.</p>

        <div>Go vegan for the animals.</div>
        <p>Vegans believe killing is not justified. 
          Ultimately, humans take away life. Other animals do not ‘give up their life’ as some people believe – they have not given consent to be slaughtered. In over 95% of cases they are killed prematurely:
          <ul>
            <li>Cows, for example, could live to well over 20 years of age, while on 'dairy' farms they are usually shot between 3-4 years of age when milk production is no longer considered 'profitable'. Cows bred for 'beef' meat are killed sooner.</li>
            <li>Broiler chicks are just 6 weeks old and grown too rapidly to sustain their own weight and heart when they are killed. Chickens could live to 10 years old.</li>  
            <li>Pigs are slaughtered when they have reached a certain weight, which will be later in organic systems than in intensive farms, but they are typically killed between 4-6 months of age, while they could reach 15 years.</li>
            <li>Sheep can also live to 15 years but depending on whether they are slaughtered as lambs or later, they are shot and bled between 3-10 months of age.</li>
            <li>Every week in the UK 3,000 male calves are killed shortly after birth, usually within days, and over 40 million day-old chicks are killed each year, including those from organic farms. Males do not secrete bodily fluids destined for offspring (cow's milk), or lay eggs like hens do. Calves are either shot or exported alive to mainland European countries where they are kept.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A lot of people opt for a vegan lifestyle because of animal exploitation. We all know that animals have emotions and feelings. This will be confirmed to you by those who have pets. Animals in industry live in poor conditions, very short life even if their lifespan is much longer. Vegan philosophy believes that all living beings have the right to life and freedom.
             
            Roughly 60 billion land animals and over a trillion (!) marine animals
            are used and killed as commodities per year, merely to satisfy human taste preferences.</p>
          <p>However, avoiding animal products is one of the most obvious ways you can take a stand against animal cruelty and animal exploitation everywhere.</p>

        <div>Go vegan for the people.</div>
        <p>Above all, it is the health of each individual. A well-planned vegan diet follows healthy eating guidelines and contains all the nutrients our body needs. Both the British Dietetic Association and the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recognize that they are suitable for every age and stage of life. Some research links a vegan diet to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and lower rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.

          With the introduction of a varied plant-based diet, you will enrich the menu with nutrients that are full of useful fibers, vitamins and minerals. All this is found in whole grains, fruits, nuts, seeds and vegetables.
          
          The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 1 in 9 people is chronically malnourished. by avoiding animal products we reduce the burden on food and other resources such as water, the use of plastics, antibiotics ... And with all this taking a stand against inefficient food systems that disproportionately affect the poorest people around the world.</p>

        <div>Go vegan for the planet.</div>
        <p>Today's global food and water insecurity, due to countless environmental and socio-economic problems, requires rapid response and change. A more sustainable way of life is needed. One of the simplest steps an individual can take is plat-based living.

          The fact that
          A plant-based diet requires only 1/3 of the land needed to grow a meat and dairy diet.
          
          It is estimated that the human population will reach between 9 and 11 billion by 2050. One of the most important questions is how to feed people when the lands on our planet are limited. Meat production and thus the meat diet are losing and wasting such important resources. Farm animals feed on plant proteins rather than ‘produce’ it as much. 5.5 kg of protein from food is needed to produce 1 kg of poultry and about 8 kg to produce 1 kg of pork.
          
          With 65 billion chickens consumed each year, this could be the age of the chicken

          For example, it takes 15,500 litres of water to produce 1 kg beef, contrasted with 180 litres for 1 kg tomatoes and 250 litres for 1 kg potatoes.
          Consuming animal products is incredibly resource-intensive. Globally, farming uses about 70% of the planet’s accessible freshwater. This is compared to around 20% for industry, and about 10% for domestic use.
          
          How much water does it take to produce a kilogram of meat or a kilogram of potatoes? The difference is so huge and shows how much drinking water is consumed when someone eats a kilogram of meat.
